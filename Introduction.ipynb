    "The goal of this project is to create a basic artificial intelligence (AI) for the game of chess. This AI should use a search algorithm and an evaluation function to find an effective move in as little time as possible. The AI should be able to play both the white and the black pieces. Additionally, it should be possible for a human player to either play against this AI themselves, or set up a game where two AIs play against each other. The project should use the _python-chess_ library (see [Fiekas, N. \\[2022a\\]](Bibliography.ipynb#FN22a)) for basic chess functionality, including a graphical user interface (GUI).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can explain how this is achieved, we must first establish some formal definitions. The implemented search algorithms, as well as other functionality, rely on these definitions."

    "Chess is a __two-player zero-sum game with perfect information__. This means that it meets the following criteria:\n",
    "1. __Two-player__: the game is played by exactly two players.\n",
    "1. __Zero-sum__: one player's gain is the other player's loss (see [Wolfram Research, Inc. \\[2022a\\]](Bibliography.ipynb#WR22a)). In the context of chess, a move that's good for white is bad for black, and vice versa.\n",
    "1. __Perfect information__: both players are completely informed about the game state and the previously performed moves (see [Wolfram Research, Inc. \\[2022b\\]](Bibliography.ipynb#WR22b)). In the context of chess, both the white and the black player can see the complete chess board and know which moves both of them have made. As a result, they also know what moves are available to each player on a given board state.\n",

    "The following definition of a two-player zero-sum game with perfect information, from here on simply referred to as a game, is inspired by [Stroetmann, K. (2022)](Bibliography.ipynb#KS22). We define a game $\\texttt{G}$ as a seven-tuple\n",

    "1. $\\texttt{Moves}$ is the set of possible moves that can be made in the game. For chess, this is the set of all legal moves on all chess board states.\n",
    "1. $\\texttt{Players}$ is a list of length 2 that contains the players of the game. $\\texttt{Players}[1]$ makes the first move. For chess, $\\texttt{Players}[1] = \\texttt{white}$ and $\\texttt{Players}[2] = \\texttt{black}$.\n",
    "1. $\\texttt{legalMoves}$ is a function that returns all legal moves that a player $\\texttt{p} \\in \\texttt{Players}$ can make in a given state $\\texttt{s} \\in \\texttt{States}$. It has the following signature:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\\texttt{legalMoves: States} \\times \\texttt{Players} \\rightarrow 2^\\texttt{Moves}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $\\texttt{finished}$ is a function that returns whether the game is finished in a given state $\\texttt{s} \\in \\texttt{States}$. It has the following signature:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\\texttt{finished: States} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{B}$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "    where $\\mathbb{B}$ is the set of boolean values, i.e. $\\mathbb{B} := \\{\\texttt{True}, \\texttt{False}\\}$.  \n",
    "    With the function $\\texttt{finished}$, we can define the set $\\texttt{TerminalStates}$ as the set of all states in which the game has finished. $\\texttt{TerminalStates}$ is defined as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "    $$\\texttt{utility: TerminalStates} \\times \\texttt{Players} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}$$  \n",

    "    If the player $\\texttt{p}$ has won, $\\texttt{utility}$ returns a very high positive value. If the player $\\texttt{p}$ has lost, $\\texttt{utility}$ returns a very high negative value. If the game has ended in a draw, $\\texttt{utility}$ returns a somewhat high positive value if the player $\\texttt{p}$ is in a disadvantageous position, because the draw is better than the loss they would most likely experience otherwise. If the game has ended in a draw but the player $\\texttt{p}$ is in an advantageous position instead, $\\texttt{utility}$ returns a somewhat high negative value, as they would be likely to win the game if they didn't take the draw."

    "In the context of a game as defined earlier, a __heuristic__ is a function that approximates how good a move $\\texttt{m} \\in \\texttt{Moves}$ from player $\\texttt{p} \\in \\texttt{Players}$ in a given state $\\texttt{s} \\in \\texttt{States}$ is. This is useful for search algorithms, which look a certain number of moves ahead and try to find the move that leads to the most advantageous position in the future. For this purpose, we also add a parameter $\\texttt{o} \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$, which is $\\texttt{-1}$ if $\\texttt{p}$ is the opponent player and $\\texttt{1}$ otherwise. This cannot be directly derived from the parameter $\\texttt{p}$, as either player may start the search, therefore the opponent player may be different between different searches.\n",

(1988)](Bibliography.ipynb#SC88), there are roughly ${10}^{43}$ legal chess positions, a number far too great for any modern computer to evaluate. Therefore, these search algorithms require a heuristic function to approximate the effectiveness of different moves and choose the best move accordingly.\n",
